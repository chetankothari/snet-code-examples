# Basic usage of js sdk on Node.js

This repo contains sample code for invoking simple AI service calls using the snet-sdk on Node.js.

You could explore the code under `src` directory.

## Running the code sample locally
Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/singnet/snet-code-examples.git
$ cd snet-code-examples
```

Then change your current directory to nodejs
```
$ cd nodejs
```

Install all the dependencies 
```
$ npm install
```

Once you have installed the dependencies all that you have to do is, make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env` at the root of the repo.
```
$ cp .env.example .env
``` 

Update `.env` to add appropriate configurations and you should be all set to run the sample code.

Run the sample code
```
$ npm start
```
