# SNET client code example for Python using snet-sdk

To generate the client libraries required by the snet-sdk, you need the SingularityNET Command Line Interface, or CLI, which you can download from PyPi, see [https://github.com/singnet/snet-cli#installing-with-pip](https://github.com/singnet/snet-cli#installing-with-pip)
  
This example uses the `translation` service from the `snet` organization and it works on the `Kovan` network. Once you have the CLI installed, run the following command:
```bash
snet sdk generate-client-library python snet translation
```
  
Now, by default the sdk is going to look for those client libraries in the `./grpc/snet/translation` directory, so move or copy the code generated by the CLI there.

Finally, the client code example expects a `config.py` file with a private key in it. Rename `config.py.sample` to `config.py` and edit it to include your private key.  
You should have Kovan ETH and Kovan AGI in the wallet associated with your private key for the example to work.

To get Kovan ETH, please see this link: [https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet)
